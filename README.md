This is a 404-not-found page that can be found [here](https://404-not-found.meicoder.com/)

This is my first challenge completed and published successfully, so I'm very proud of myself. In the beginning, it looked so easy but I faced with some problems in footer section because it was not on the correct place in desktop version. At the end, I could figure it out and practice some concepts in CSS.

I completed this task using HTML and pure CSS, but then I decided to use .scss files in order to improve this skill. Also, this was my first time publishing at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) and it was easy to publish by following the documentation.
